/**
 * The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically, 
    without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. 
 * It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.
 * This pattern is useful when you need to add functionality to objects in a flexible and reusable way.
 * This pattern is vital for enhancing functionality while adhering to the open-closed principle.
